Google homepage project from TOP

Feels like I didn't use the appropriate tools to get the desired result, spent a lot of time adjusting margins, paddings etc.. manually instead of relying on Flexbox or Grid. 
Also, used a few "position: absolute" which I don't think is a good solution to layout problems, it only works in this case because the page design is so simple.

Still, the objective was to obtain a visually similar page which I think I succeeded in. Maybe I will come back when I have more experience to see what I did wrong.
